    <p>
      This database documents all in-person interactions between the Australian Prime Minister and the US President since the beginning of the George W. Bush Administration. It details the location of meetings, main topics of discussion, and enables conclusions to be drawn about the frequency and nature of leader-to-leader contact over the last 16 years under presidents and prime ministers from both sides of politics. 
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>
      Since Bush was inaugurated in January 2001, the US President has hosted the Australian Prime Minister in the Oval Office on 12 occasions – <a href="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/visits">more than the comparable figure for both the Japanese and Canadian Prime Ministers</a>. During his eight-year term, Barack Obama hosted Rudd (2), Gillard (1), Abbott (1), and Turnbull (1) in the Oval Office a total of five times, while Bush hosted Howard (6) and Rudd (1) a total of seven times. Bush and Obama each visited Australia twice during their presidencies, for one bilateral visit and one international summit apiece. 
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>
      Across the Bush and Obama presidencies, the president saw the prime minister roughly 3.4 times per year in a formal or informal capacity. During their eight-year presidencies, Bush held more official bilateral meetings with his counterpart (10) than Obama (6), but Obama conducted more meetings on the sidelines of international summits (6) than Bush (3). Bush attended a regional or global summit with the Australian Prime Minister on 10 occasions, where for Obama the figure was 29. 
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>
      The upward trend in the frequency of personal contact under President Obama – if not necessarily the length or depth of direct leader-to-leader engagement – was largely due to the proliferation of presidential attendance at multilateral meetings. In addition to longstanding presidential and prime ministerial attendance at summits such as the UN General Assembly, <a href="https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/regional-architecture/asean/Pages/association-of-southeast-asian-nations-asean.aspx">ASEAN</a>, <a href="https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/regional-architecture/apec/Pages/asia-pacific-economic-cooperation-apec.aspx">APEC</a> and <a href="https://www.nato.int/nato-welcome/index.html">NATO</a>, the US has attended the <a href="https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/international-organisations/g20/Pages/the-g20.aspx">G20</a> since President Bush first hosted the grouping in 2008, while President Obama was the first US leader to attend the <a href="https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/regional-architecture/eas/Pages/east-asia-summit-eas.aspx">East Asia Summit (EAS)</a> in 2011. Indeed, Obama was only absent at one EAS thereafter (2013) owing to a US government <a href='https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-04/obama-withdraws-from-apec-summit/4999006'>shutdown</a> at the time.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>
      By contrast, Trump <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/10/24/trump-to-skip-key-asia-summit-in-philippines-to-go-home-earlier/?utm_term=.d600fea4d96a'>will reportedly miss</a> next month’s EAS in the Philippines despite being in the country for the ASEAN summit the preceding day. Presidential attendance at Asia-Pacific multilateral organisations is perceived by Asian partners as a sign of American commitment to the region.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>
    If the Bush and Obama presidencies are an accurate guide to the future, we should expect to see President Trump interacting in a formal or informal setting with the Australian Prime Minister at least 10 times by the time his first term expires in January 2021. This would include a couple of Oval Office meetings, interactions at Asian and global summits, and perhaps even a Trump visit to Australia – an intention he <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-05/donald-trump-plays-down-malcolm-turnbull-tension-in-ny-meeting/8499146">made clear</a> at the Coral Sea Commemoration – including a potential address to Parliament.

          On his last day of the Asian summit season, Turnbull had a <a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2017/11/14/turnbull-meets-with-trump-in-manila.html" target="_blank">30-minute meeting</a> with Trump at the president’s hotel suite. The two leaders had originally <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/malcolm-turnbull-donald-trump-private-dinner-scrapped-20171113-gzkpqu.html" target="_blank">planned to meet for a private dinner</a> on Monday night, but it was rescheduled because the pair had met earlier in the day. No officials were present at the meeting.

The leaders reiterated their shared “fundamental values” and “strategic interests” and emphasised their cooperation on dealing with North Korea. On trade, Trump noted that the United States had deficits with “almost everybody”, to which Turnbull quipped, “Except us!”

          Two days prior to the September 11 attacks, Howard hosted a barbecue at the Australian Ambassador’s residence for Bush and several of his Cabinet members, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and two Supreme Court Justices. The next day, the two leaders <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010910-1.html" target="_blank">commemorated the 50th anniversary</a> of the US-Australia alliance at the Washington Navy Yard before heading to the Oval Office for their first official meeting. Following the terrorist attacks, Howard attended a sitting in Congress before <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-12.html" target="_blank">invoking Article IV</a> of the ANZUS Treaty on September 14, committing Australia to America’s defence.
